# SBA 320H - React Web Application Project

# About 
 My goal with this project was to make a to-do list that was more in-depth than some of the examples I have seen so far. My goal is to eventually include the following: 
    - be able to log in 
    - be able to add, edit and delete todos
    - be able to add sub tasks to todo items with checkboxes 
    - track overall completed tasks with a completed task counter
    - be able to create your own task bins or columns and be able to drag and drop items into different columns 

To satisfy the project requirements, I have also used the dummyJSON API to provide user data 

due to time constraints, I was not able to implement all the things I wanted, but I am looking forward to continuing to work on this project to make it work. 

# Dependencies 
this project uses to following dependencies: 
- react-router-dom 

# Installation 
to install this project please follow these steps: 
- 

--- below are the instructions for this project from Per Scholas --- 

# Instructions 
Now, it is time for you to put everything you've learned to the test and apply it to a practical web application.

The content, context, and objective of your application is entirely up to you. Be creative, and think of something that will both allow you to demonstrate the skills you've acquired thus far and solve a need (practical or fictional).

Once you have an idea for your project, keeping the below requirements and resources in mind, speak to your instructor to have your project approved before you begin. This will ensure you're on the right track from the start, and not running into unforseen issues or wasting time on something that will not satisfy the assignment's objectives.

# Requirements

Your application must meet these requirements to pass (this it your Minimum Viable Product):
1. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and REACT. (done)
2. Hosted on Heroku or Netlify.
3. Frequent commits to GitHub. (done)
4. A README.md file in your GitHub repository with:
    - Explanations of the technologies used.
    - Explanations of the approach taken. 
    - A link to your live site.
    - Usage instructions, if relevant.
    - Unsolved problems. 
    - etc.
5. Use AJAX to make a request to an external data source like OMDBapi, and insert some of the data retrieved into the DOM. (grabbed todo info from external API to show on the page)

# Bonus Features 
- use Redux Toolkit.
- Have one or more complex user interface modules such as a carousel, drag and drop, a sticky nav, tooltips, etc.
- Look into localstorage so you can save data to the user's browser.

# Finding an API
Below is a non-exhaustive list of some free APIs you can use. There are many APIs out there, so if you find one not on this list that you'd like to use, feel free! Please note that some may require signing up for an API key (e.g. the Marvel API).
Marvel
Weather
News
Giphy
Pokemon
Card Deck
Google Books
City of Chicago
Beer
Chuck Norris
Rick and Morty
Lastly, the following sites collect a bunch of APIs together, so you can take a look through their libraries and try to find an API that interests you!

Public APIs List
Rapid API
Note, however, that not all APIs are free, and many listed may require payment. We highly suggest to use a free API for your first project dealing with one.

Please be extremely thorough when finding an API you'd like to use for your project. In other words, please ensure you have properly vetted your API by taking the time to read its documentation and even "hitting a few endpoints".

Do this BEFORE you decide to seek instructor approval.

This ensures you're taking the time to test the API, see how you can get it to respond with data, and see what that data looks like.

# Make a New GitHub Repo
After your project has been approved, make a new GitHub repo for your project. You will be deploying this project onto GitHub pages, so you must name your repo yourgithubusername.github.io (for example, if my github username was octocat I would do: octocat.github.io).

From there, follow the instructions outlined by GitHub themselves on GitHub Pages.

Extra: Want your own domain name?
You can also host your github pages with your own domain name.
Here is a walkthrough from namecheap, one web hosting service.
If you choose to do this, it is best to save it for last so that you know you have time to finish the project's requirements.

# Project Submission
Submit the link to your GitHub repository to Canvas when you are finished.

You will present your project and show your code to classmates and instructors.

Being able to explain and articulate your process, objectives, blockers, and successes is an important part of being a developer, but don't be intimidated by the "presentation" aspect. These are your peers, and they're in the same position as you are.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
